# QPS Delivery Service  ðŸšš
A Python-based program designed to optimize delivery routes using the **nearest distance algorithm**. This program calculates the most efficient route for deliveries, reducing travel time and improving overall efficiency. Ideal for anyone looking to streamline the delivery process.

## Key Features
- **Route Optimization:** Automatically calculates the shortest and most efficient path for deliveries, minimizing overall distance or time.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** The program utilizes **hashtables** for fast storage and retrieval of delivery locations, enhancing the performance of the nearest distance algorithm.
- **Delivery Status Menu:** Allows users to check the status of packages and trucks in real-time:
  - Check package status at a specific time.
  - View the status of all packages at a given time.
  - See total miles traveled by all trucks.
  - Exit the program.
